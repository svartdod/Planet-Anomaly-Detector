# Plant Anomaly Detection

This project provides a complete workflow for detecting anomalies in
plant images using modern computer‑vision techniques. It is implemented
in a Jupyter Notebook (`Plant_Anomaly_detection.ipynb`) and is intended
for research, prototyping, and potential deployment in agricultural
monitoring systems.

## Overview

-   Automatically detect anomalies such as disease, discoloration, or
    structural defects.
-   Preprocess plant images for consistent model input.
-   Train an anomaly‑detection model on healthy plant samples.
-   Evaluate anomaly intensity and generate visual anomaly heatmaps.
